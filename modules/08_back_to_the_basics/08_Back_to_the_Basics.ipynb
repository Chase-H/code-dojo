    "This session is inspired by some conversations I have had recently about some of the aspects of Python we take for granted. I think a lot of developers who have worked with Python for a long time and are very good developers, do not have a full understanding of some of the lower level details and logistics of how the language actually runs on their computer. I hope that by the end of this session, everyone will have a greater understanding of how Python is operating and what is actually happening when they perform common tasks with the language."

    "Python is a high-level programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum. The first version of Python was released in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. This initial version already featured classes with inheritance, exception handling, functions, and core datatypes of list, dict, str and others. Guido van Rossum was influenced by the ABC language, a teaching language he helped create at CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica) in the Netherlands designed to be easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the foreword to the book \"Programming Python: Powerful Object-Oriented Programming,\" van Rossum stated that his primary goal in designing Python was to create a language that was easy to understand and write. He cited the importance of a short development cycle, where the time between conceiving a program and creating it is as short as possible. The design of Python also reflected his own personal taste in programming language features, borrowing elements from different languages such as ABC, Modula-3, and C.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Python is to be readable, easy to use, flexible (in that it allows multiple paradigms), and high level (meaning you do not need to concern yourself with lower level functioning like garbage collection when writing)."

    "3. **Dynamic typing and duck typing**: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable when you create it - Python infers it at runtime. Additionally, Python uses duck typing, a concept that allows you to use objects based on their characteristics, not on their types. As the saying goes, \"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\"\n",

    "The Python interpreter is the core machinery that executes your Python programs. It's responsible for taking Python scripts, compiling them into bytecode, and then executing that bytecode within the Python runtime environment. The term \"Python interpreter\" is often used interchangeably to refer to the Python implementation itself, which includes not just the interpreter but also the standard libraries, the built-in types and functions, and the garbage collector.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a Python script is run, the interpreter first parses the source code, converting it into an Abstract Syntax Tree ([AST](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html)). The AST is then compiled into bytecode, which is a low-level, platform-independent representation of the source code. This step involves several stages: tokenization, parsing into a parse tree, creation of the AST, and finally, compilation into bytecode.\n",
    "\n",
    "This bytecode is then stored in .pyc files to speed up subsequent executions of the script. If the original .py file hasn't been modified since the .pyc file was created, the interpreter will skip the tokenization, parsing, and compilation stages and execute the .pyc file directly.\n",

The interpreter compares the creation timestamp of the `.pyc` file with the source file to determine if it needs to \"re-compile\".\n",

    "\n",
    "When we re-import, we do not see the \"importing...\" message and we do not pick up the new changes. This is because the designers of python decided packages should only be imported once per interactive session for efficiency reasons. However, if you want to keep a session live and be able to pick up module changes, you can use [importlib.reload](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.reload). If you have ever used a framework like Django or FastAPI that will pick up changes without you needed to stop the service, it is using importlib.realod to do so (see [dicsussion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/437591)). For example:\n",

By default, if you do not change your [pip config settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/configuration/), you will be pulling from PyPi when you run a `pip install <package command>` So, what happens when you actually pip install something. In the old days of pip, you were basically just running a straight download and if the package you were downloading was inconsistent with your dependencies, you would not find out until you tried to run something. However, in November 2020 in version 20.3, pip added a dependency resolver (see [announcement](https://discuss.python.org/t/announcement-pip-20-3-release/5948)). The lack of a dependency resolver was one of the things that drove people to using virtual environment managers like conda (more on that below).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at a basic level, the install process that `pip install` uses can be thought of as a download of packages that people build using tools like `setuptools` via a `setup.py` file, or tools like poetry and push to PyPi (devs can also build packages via [recipes](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/stable/concepts/recipe.html) and push to a different public repository conda-forge). So, where do these downloads get stored?\n",

Once installed, if you want to find out where a module's files are located, you can import the module and check the dunder `__file__` attribute.

    "### Parting Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the day, it's about what works for you and what gets the job done. I am a big proponent of engineering teams deciding on a single way of managing virtual environments, packages, and dependencies because it makes it infinitely easier to debug other developers issues when they are doing local development. Otherwise, you will spend the first chunk of time just trying to figure out how the other dev is managing their environment and making sure there aren't any oddities occurring as a result of that process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, I would like to stress that the above options are not mutually exclusive. You can use Conda to install a new Python version, then create an venv or poetry virtual environment within that Conda environment. I do not know if this is just because I have spent so many years using Conda, but anecdotally, I have seen far fewer odd environment related issues with Conda than I have with venv, virtualenv, or Poetry. However, take my opinions with a grain of salt and do what works best for you. All I ask is, whatever tool/process you use, make sure you use it because you believe it is the best option and not just because it is the one you used first 😄 "
