    "\n",
    "Pandas is a Python tool for data analysis and manipulation (fun fact, the name \"Pandas\" is derived from an econometrics term: \"**pa**nel **da**ta\"). Pandas is written in Python, Cython, and C, and heavily leverages [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), the bulk of which is [written in C](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html#why-is-numpy-fast). This makes Pandas suprisingly performant for a Python package. However, as we will see, Pandas definitely has it's limits and we will discuss optimization techniques and alternatives in the [performance section](#pandas_performance).\n",
    "\n",
    "At its base, Pandas is a package containing custom data structures that make data analysis in Python much easier than it ever was before. The main data structure is the [DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe). A DataFrame is a tabular representation of your data. It contains rows, columns, and an index. Under the hood, a DataFrame is 2 dimensional data structure made up of [Series](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#series) which are 1 dimensional labeled arrays of data. Series can be thought of as the columns in your Pnadas DataFrame. "

    "Side note, DataFrames allow you access specific rows or columns by index. There are two DataFrame methods available, [loc()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html#pandas-dataframe-iloc) and [iloc()](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html#pandas-dataframe-iloc). This difference between these 2 methods is that `iloc()` selects by index position and `loc()` selects by index label. Since our DataFrame contains a properly ordered numeric index the examples below are all using `iloc()`. For further reading, please refer to this [StackOverflow post](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.iloc.html#pandas-dataframe-iloc)."

    "Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. What this means at a base level is Numba is a tool you can use to take dynamically typed and interpretted Python code and turn it into compiled machine code that can offer serious performance improvements. There are two main ways to implement Numba: (1) by specifying the engine when executing built-in Pandas computation methods, or (2) by writing your own custom functions and utilizing the [@jit decorator](https://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/jit.html). Let's take a look at setting a custom engine:"

    "### One solution addresses speed and memory: Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask, much like Cython, is a fairly deep and complex topic onto itself and is deserving of a session onto itself. However, Dask is such a useful tool when dealing with large datasets, it is worth exploration here. Dask is an open-source python project which parallelizes Numpy and Pandas. Under the hood, a Dask Dataframe consists of many Pandas dataframes that are manipulated in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be asking yourself \"how can Dask handle datasets that are too large for Pandas if it uses Pandas under the hood?\" The answer lies in how Dask handles computation. Computations in Dask are lazy by default. This means that tasks do do not execute immediately but instead build up in a task graph until `compute()` is called. Once `compute()` is called, Dask starts executing the task graph using partial loads while utilizing all cores (not just one as is the case in Pandas). After computing the intermediate results, Dask combines them and returns the combined result.\n",
